I will keep track of our interactions here.

**Interaction on Monday, July 7, 2025:**
- User provided context about the current working directory and file structure.
- Agent acknowledged the context.
- User requested to remove all code related to generation and testing of synthetic data.
- Agent identified relevant files: `src/generate_simulated_data.py`, `src/monitor.py`, and `src/validate_unseen.py`.
- Agent deleted `src/generate_simulated_data.py`.
- Agent modified `src/monitor.py` to remove reference to simulated data.
- Agent modified `src/validate_unseen.py` to remove reference to simulated data ground truth.
- Agent verified no other files in `src/` reference the deleted module.
- User requested to remove irrelevant files and folders from the project.
- Agent read `README.md` to understand project structure.
- Agent proposed and removed the following files/directories:
    - `build_features_output.txt`
    - `reconnect_instructions.txt`
    - `data/simulated/`
    - `validation_results/`
    - `visualizations/`
- Agent confirmed `venv/` is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Agent confirmed `data/raw/` files follow the correct schema.
- Agent removed `src/data_processing.py` as it contained synthetic data generation code.
- Agent ran the full pipeline and validated the model:
    - Data Ingestion: Successful
    - Data Quality Checks: Successful
    - Feature Engineering: Successful
    - Model Training: Successful
    - Hyperparameter Tuning: Successful
    - Model Validation: Successful (MAE: 0.0597, MSE: 0.0068, R-squared: 0.9930)
- User requested to analyze model performance based on scores and graphs.
- Agent analyzed the model performance and provided insights.
- User requested to push changes to GitHub.
- Agent staged all changes and provided a commit message.
- User approved the commit message, but the commit failed due to tool limitations.
- Agent informed the user about the manual commit command.
- User confirmed that generated graphs were included in the commit.
- Agent confirmed that generated graphs were included in the commit.
- User provided specific fixes for `ingest_data` call in `src/pipeline.py` and `build_features` call in `tests/test_pipelines.py`.
- Agent applied the requested fixes.
- Agent re-ran the full pipeline and validated the model to verify fixes:
    - Data Ingestion: Successful
    - Data Quality Checks: Successful
    - Feature Engineering: Successful
    - Model Training: Successful
    - Hyperparameter Tuning: Successful
    - Model Validation: Successful (MAE: 0.0606, MSE: 0.0068, R-squared: 0.9929)
