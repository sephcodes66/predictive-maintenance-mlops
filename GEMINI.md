I will keep track of our interactions here.

**Interaction on Monday, July 7, 2025:**
- User provided context about the current working directory and file structure.
- Agent acknowledged the context.
- User requested to remove all code related to generation and testing of synthetic data.
- Agent identified relevant files: `src/generate_simulated_data.py`, `src/monitor.py`, and `src/validate_unseen.py`.
- Agent deleted `src/generate_simulated_data.py`.
- Agent modified `src/monitor.py` to remove reference to simulated data.
- Agent modified `src/validate_unseen.py` to remove reference to simulated data ground truth.
- Agent verified no other files in `src/` reference the deleted module.
- User requested to remove irrelevant files and folders from the project.
- Agent read `README.md` to understand project structure.
- Agent proposed and removed the following files/directories:
    - `build_features_output.txt`
    - `reconnect_instructions.txt`
    - `data/simulated/`
    - `validation_results/`
    - `visualizations/`
- Agent confirmed `venv/` is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Agent confirmed `data/raw/` files follow the correct schema.
- Agent removed `src/data_processing.py` as it contained synthetic data generation code.
- Agent ran the full pipeline and validated the model:
    - Data Ingestion: Successful
    - Data Quality Checks: Successful
    - Feature Engineering: Successful
    - Model Training: Successful
    - Hyperparameter Tuning: Successful
    - Model Validation: Successful (MAE: 0.0597, MSE: 0.0068, R-squared: 0.9930)
