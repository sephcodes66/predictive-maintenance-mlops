1. Refocus the Project Theme for an Industrial Context
What's Missing: Your project is a "Churn Prediction" model, which is a common business problem but doesn't reflect the factory setting mentioned in Pirelli's core activities.

How to Improve:

Change the Problem: Switch from customer churn to Predictive Maintenance or Anomaly Detection for quality control. This directly relates to monitoring processes in a factory.

Find a Relevant Dataset: Use a public dataset like the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation dataset. This will immediately make your project more relevant and show that you've thought about the company's specific domain.

2. Deepen the Implementation of TDD and OOP
What's Missing: While you have a tests folder, the implementation of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) can be more robust and explicit.

How to Improve:

Expand Test Coverage: Increase the number and scope of your tests using pytest. Write tests that cover not just data processing but also model behavior. For example, create a test to ensure your model's predictions don't change if an irrelevant feature is modified (invariance test).

Refactor into More Classes: While you have modular files, you can further demonstrate OOP by creating more defined classes. For example, create a Pipeline class that orchestrates the data processing, training, and tuning steps, or a ModelEvaluator class that handles the calculation of all metrics. This will better showcase your advanced OOP skills.

3. Integrate SQL More Deeply
What's Missing: The job requires "Advanced SQL knowledge." Your project likely uses Python's pandas for data manipulation, but you can explicitly add SQL to demonstrate this skill.

How to Improve:

SQL for Data Validation: Use a library like duckdb to run complex SQL queries directly on your pandas DataFrames for data validation within your tests. For example, write a SQL query to check for the number of outliers or the distribution of values in a key sensor reading.

SQL-based Feature Store (Simulation): In your data processing step, write your engineered features to a local SQLite database and read them back in the training step. This simulates a real-world feature store and provides a clear place to demonstrate your SQL skills.

4. Enhance the MLOps and Monitoring Story
What's Missing: The project shows a good local structure, but the full MLOps lifecycle (deployment, monitoring) and the "Monitoring ML processes" aspect from the job description are not yet visible.

How to Improve:

Add a Deployment Script: Create a simple deployment script using a web framework like FastAPI. This script should load your trained model from mlruns and create a REST API endpoint that can serve predictions.

Implement CI/CD with GitHub Actions: Create a .github/workflows/ directory and add a YAML file to automate your testing. Configure it so that every time you push code to your repository, it automatically runs all your pytest tests. This is a critical MLOps practice.

Simulate Monitoring: Create a simple script or notebook that generates a "monitoring dashboard." This can be a set of plots that track hypothetical incoming sensor data over time and compare its distribution to your training data to check for data drift. This directly addresses the "monitoring" requirement.
